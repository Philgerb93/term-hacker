# Terminal Hacker

Inspired by the hacking minigame from the Fallout series.
Terminal hacker is a word game where the user has to guess
the correct password amongst 15 words. Each failed attempt
gives the user the number of matching letters between the
guess and the answer. The player has 4 attempts, if he uses
them all, he loses.
